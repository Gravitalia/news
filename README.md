# [*Gravitalia* News](https://news.gravitalia.com/) (aka Poios)
> News aggregator and Q&A ML-generated about news.

## Story
As a high school student, I decided to create my own digital newspaper called *Poios* (which means "who" and is derived from Ceos, "who knows everything").
And when I went on to study law and economics, I thought I'd take Poios even further and integrate it into a more advanced ecosystem. Poios (or *Gravitalia News*) now aggregates news from other media and my own writings, and offers summaries and quizzes to make learning about the news easier!
